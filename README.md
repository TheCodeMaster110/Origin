# Origin
This project is a custom Minecraft Origins datapack created to help me practice working with JSON, including power creation, entity conditions, modifiers, and datapack structure.
It serves as a learning space for experimenting with Origins mechanics and structuring custom abilities.

# Purpose 
The main goal is to improve my understanding of:
Writing JSON power files
Correctly using Origins types, conditions, and modifiers
Organizing datapack file structure
Debugging common datapack issues
Testing gameplay balance and effects in Minecraft
This datapack is not intended to be a full release — it’s a hands-on practice environment to learn, break things, and fix them.

# Features 
Custom powers using Origins JSON schemas
Damage modifiers
Status effects
Item-based conditions (e.g., using specific weapons)
Custom weaknesses and strengths
Experiments with tags, conditions, and entity interactions
Additional experimental features may be added as I continue learning.
